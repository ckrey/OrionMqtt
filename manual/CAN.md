# CAN {#can}

[CAN-Bus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus) (for *controller area network*) is a data link layer protocol used in newer vehicles which is used for monitoring and controlling most components of the car.

Greenwich Advanced devices are equipped with a CAN-Bus interface. This interface supports 11-bit or 29-bit identifiers and 250 or 500 kBit/s transfer speeds.

Other protocols could be in use in (older) vehicles (e.g. PWM, VPW, ISO 9142, KWP), but these are not supported by Greenwich devices natively.


### OBD

*On-board diagnostics* [OBD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics#OBD-II) is a communication protocol for automotive diagnostics.

Owntracks Greenwich implements the current *OBD-II* (or *OBD2*) version.

### FMS

*Fleet Management System* [FMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Management_System) is a standard interface for commercial vehicles like trucks and buses.

Owntracks Greenwich supports FMS.

### Cabling

![OBD-II to Greenwich](art/obd2-2-gw-pic.png)

To connect the Greenwich to your vehicle you need an OBD-II male plug, and you must connect the CAN-bus pins to the respective S2 Molex pins according to the wiring chart below:

![OBD-II to Greenwich Wiring](art/obd2-2-gw-wiring.png)

A variety of OBD-II plugs are available in electronics stores. A plug with an attached cable terminated in an DE-9 female connector is quite handy. Just solder the light blue and white wires of Greenwich's S2 connector to a DE-9 male connector and you are ready to go.

### OwnTracks Greenwich functionality

The Greenwich monitors the vehicle FMS and OBD-II interfaces periodically. The data is published to the MQTT broker in raw format. Interpretation, processing, alarm management is performed in the backend. 

Data transmission is optimized. All values are cached in the Greenwich device and published only if changes occur.

In OBD-II, Greenwich reads all available information (may differ per vehicle type):

* of up to 8 Engine Control Units (*ECU*)
* Modes 1, 2, 3, and 9 according to the specification [OBD-II-PIDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs)
	this includes Mode 3 *DTC*s (Diagnostic Trouble Codes)

For FMS, Greenwich provides the full set of information:

### Settings

The FMS/OBD functionality in OwnTracks Greenwich is controlled by 3 settings:

* `fms`=`0/1` Switches the FMS interface off or on
* `obd2Interval`=_seconds_ The complete set of available OBD-II data is read every _seconds_. If set to zero, OBD-II data is not read.
* `obd2Sensors`=_seconds_ Mode 1 of available OBD-II data is read every _seconds_. If set to zero, Mode 1 data is not read.
* `obd2Speed`=`kBit/s` transmission speed for OBD-II protocol, default is 500
* `obd2Addresses`=`comma-separated-addresses` defaults to `000007e8,000007e9,000007ea,000007eb,000007ec,000007ed,000007ee,000007ef0`
* `obd2Mode`=`STD/EXT` switches between 11 or 29 bit identifier addresses in the OBD-II protocol
