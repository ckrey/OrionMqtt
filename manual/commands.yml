- login:
    params: "_secret_"
    auth: true
    desc: |
        A successful login expires after `loginTimeout` seconds, and _secret_
        is checked from settings, initially provisioned via a properties file

- logout:
    params: ""
    auth: false
    desc: |
        Logout from a logged-in session.

- set:
    params: "[_key_[=[_value_]]]"
    auth: true
    desc: |
        Show, set or delete a configuration parameter. The command `set` shows
        all _key_`=`_value_ pairs configured. To show just a single setting
        use `set key`. Configure (i.e. overwrite) a setting with `set key=value`,
        and you can delete a setting with `set key=` (empty _value_).

- bootstrap:
    params: "_see text_"
    auth: false
    desc: |
        The format and order of _params_ is `secret`, `apn`, `apnUser`,
        `apnPassword`, `host`, `port`, `user`, `password`.  If validation of
        the _secret_ is positive, `bootstrap` sets the 7 parameters and
        reboots the device. _secret_ is the same password as used for `login`.
        Parameters `apn` through `password` can be empty, but must not be omitted,
        e.g. `bootstrap secret 123456,,,ssl://somehost.somedomain,8883,,`

- state:
    params: ""
    auth: false
    desc: |

- reconnect:

    auth: true
    desc: |

- log:
    params: "_type_"
    auth: true
    desc: |
        Shows or resets log files in persistent memory. `log` shows the current
        log file, `log old` the previous, and `log delete` resets the log file.
